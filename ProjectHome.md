This piece of hardware includes a Visual Basic Activex control, which let you use the adapter from any MS Windows enabled computer easily.

This library provides a Qt 4 class that can be used to control the RDW125K in a multiplatform way.

It uses [QextSerialPort](http://qextserialport.sourceforge.net/), a serial port class developed by [Stefan Sander](mailto:stefan-sander@users.sourceforge.net)
